                <h2>Why I Liked The New <span id="mk">Moon Knight</span>, And Why Maybe You Would Too</h2>
                <blockquote><p>not spoiler free so beware</p></blockquote>
                <p>Listen, I'm not saying you have to actually <em>buy</em> a Disney+ subscription. The internet is a wonderful thing, and the resources it allows you are wonderful if you know how to search stuff up correctly.</p>
                <p>Personally, I'm not actually that much of a Marvel fan. I think they have to appease too many studio execs to be allowed too much creative freedom or chances to step outside the norm, Ã  la <em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em> from the Daniels. And, I'm not saying <em>Moon Knight</em> breaks that trend.</p>
                <p>But it was very enjoyable to watch, and I do like how they portray Marc's DID, especially in regards to the editing and how Isaac plays his alters (the accents make it easier to differentiate).</p>
                <p>That being said, Oscar Isaac plays both a crime-fighting justice-dealing chad and a pathetic little meow meow. Quality content in and of itself. If that doesn't convince you, maybe the trailer will: </p>
